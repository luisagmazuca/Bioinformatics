# Bioinformatics

Homework01 = this script reads a FASTA sequence of a genome and finds all major repeats in the sequence (greater than 10 base pairs or longer, repeated at least three times). For each major repeat, it records in a Tab delimitated file the phage name, the repeat sequence, starting and closing base # for each occurrence.

Homework01Pt2 = this script extracts the CDS (coding sequence) information from GenBank file, and places it into tab delimitated file including the phage name, the full aa sequence of the protein, and the starting and closing base, and the gene description (“product”).

Homework04 = this script extracts the gene ID and its respective start and end positions from a file, eaither from genbank or glimmer.

Homework04Pt2 = with the output from homework04 this script gives comments if they are the same gene, have different strat/end, or does not exist in eithe or.

Homework07 = parses out the IDs of the top 10 hits for each sequence. The e-value is at least 10E-6 or better. If none are this low, then it grabs only the first top hit.
