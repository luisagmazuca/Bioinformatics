# Bioinformatics

Homework01 = this script reads a FASTA sequence of a genome and finds all major repeats in the sequence (greater than 10 base pairs or longer, repeated at least three times). For each major repeat, it records in a Tab delimitated file the phage name, the repeat sequence, starting and closing base # for each occurrence

Homework01Pt2 = this script extracts the CDS (coding sequence) information from GenBank file, and places it into tab delimitated file including the phage name, the full aa sequence of the protein, and the starting and closing base, and the gene description (“product”).

Homework02 =
